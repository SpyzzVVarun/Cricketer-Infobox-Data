The official status of this match is that it was not given retrospective first-class status by the South African Cricket Board of Control, although until 1931 it was generally considered first-class. Blythe took three wickets in the match and some sources, including ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'', give him credit for 2,506 first-class wickets taken during his career. Croudy, p. 4.
