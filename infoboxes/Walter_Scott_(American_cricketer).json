    "birth_date": "ESPNcricinfo and CricketArchive give Scott's year of birth as 1864 and 1868, respectively. This is perhaps a result of his ''Wisden'' obituary, which contradictorily gives 39 as his age at his death in 1907, but 1864 as his year of birth.<ref name=\"obit\" /> If the 1864 date is correct, Joseph Scott is his younger (rather than older) brother."
